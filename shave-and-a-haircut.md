# Audio File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the "Shave and a Haircut" sound effect that would play when achievements are completed.

In a production environment, this would be replaced with an actual .mp3 file of the "Shave and a Haircut" tune.

## Sound Description
The "Shave and a Haircut" tune is a 7-note musical call-and-response couplet that goes:
* Notes: "Shave and a hair-cut — two bits"
* Rhythm: ♩ ♪ ♩ ♩ — ♩ ♩

## Implementation Note
When implemented with real audio, the file should be kept short (under 3 seconds) to ensure quick response times and a good user experience.
